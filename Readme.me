Kolmogorov Complexity Using Genetic Algorithms

A java project developed to get the information of a file. The file is given as a tape for a Turing Machine. The main idea is to make use of GA to get the shortest Turing Machine, which by definition is the Kolmogorov Complexity, and theorically is the information of the file.
